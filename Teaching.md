I believe in making all students comfortable in the classroom and helping everyone find a love for science. Many students have not had positive previous STEM experiences and it is our place as educators to show them how they can find their place in science either as a scientist or as a well rounded global citizen. Both lab and lecture should be used for a place of growth, not only for knowledge, but for critical thinking and working across disciplinary lines.

I have been awarded the Outstanding Chemistry Teaching Assistant Award in 2019, 2021, and 2022.
